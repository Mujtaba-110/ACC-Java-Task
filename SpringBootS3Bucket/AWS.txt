Loadbalancer
It distributes the traffic to the multiple EC2 instances
It increases the availability of the services or application

Cloudfront
It is  basically used for the caching
E.g., If the user try to access some services from EC2 instances then it produces high latency
In cloudfront it stores the logical address to itself and while accessing the same service it will decrease the latency
Using cloudfront the latency of services will get low

S3 Bucket
It is basically used to store the files
It contains all the file which we want to deploy to the cloud

ami 
It will create the replica of the EC2 instance

snapshot
It will create the replica of particular hardisk

lambda function

CIDR block
